        "#### Question and Answer Generation:\n",
        "1. Generate **20 questions and answers** strictly based on the provided Employee Information:\n",
        "   - **First 10 questions**: Create simple, fact-based questions focusing on individual attributes (e.g., name, role, department).\n",

        "   - Each set of questions should be unique and vary based on the context. Avoid reusing the same phrasing, structure, or logic between different datasets.\n",

        "#### Guidelines for Variation:\n",
        "- Use synonyms and rephrasing to create diversity (e.g., \"What is the employee's role?\" vs. \"Which position does the employee hold?\").\n",
        "- Introduce logical relationships for complex questions, such as connections between the employee's department, job title, and contract type.\n",
