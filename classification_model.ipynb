Then, suddenly, I got this weird notification asking me to update my password, but the message didn’t look like the usual ones I receive from the app. It looked a bit off. It’s hard to explain, but it felt like someone was inside my account, doing things while I wasn’t even online. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My work account was hackd, and then I got locked out of everything. I don’t think I’ve ever felt this violated before. My privacy is completely shattered, and I can’t do anything to make it stop. Even my tablet isn’t working right anymore. It’s so stange how everything just fell apart after that one email.\n",

The next thing I knew, people were calling me asking if I had sent them strange messages, and I hadn’t touched my phone all day. It’s hard to explain, but it felt like someone was inside my account, doing things while I wasn’t even online. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My bank account was suspecious, and then I got locked out of everything. The worst part is, I don’t even know who to trust anymore. Friends, family, everyone’s acting strange. It’s affecting my relationships and my mental health. Even my laptop isn’t working right anymore. It’s so stange how everything just fell apart after that one email.\n",

I don't know how, but it’s like they knew everything I was doing, even though I was trying to be careful. It’s terrifying to think about. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My email was frezzing, and then I got locked out of everything. I don’t think I’ve ever felt this violated before. My privacy is completely shattered, and I can’t do anything to make it stop.

Then, suddenly, I got this weird notification asking me to update my password, but the message didn’t look like the usual ones I receive from the app. It looked a bit off. It’s hard to explain, but it felt like someone was inside my account, doing things while I wasn’t even online. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My email was notifiction, and then I got locked out of everything. This has really left me anxious and frustrated, I can’t sleep knowing my information is out there. I’ve even considered deleting all my accounts, but that’s not a solution. Even my phone isn’t working right anymore. It’s so stange how everything just fell apart after that one email.\n",
